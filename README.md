## Joint Alignment of Multi-Task Feature and Label Spaces for Emotion Cause Pair Extraction
This repository contains the code of the official implementation for the paper: Joint Alignment of Multi-Task Feature and Label Spaces for Emotion Cause Pair Extraction. The paper has been accepted to appear at Coling 2022.

Some code is based on [Rank-Emotion-Cause](https://github.com/Determined22/Rank-Emotion-Cause), and [Partition Filter Network](https://github.com/Coopercoppers/PFN).

## Requirements
* CUDAï¼š11.4
* Python 3
* PyTorch 1.10.2

The code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS using a single 3090(24G).

## Quick Start
1. Download the pertrained ["BERT-Base, Chinese"](https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-chinese.tar.gz) model. And then put the model file `pytorch_model.bin` to the folder `src/bert-base-chinese`

2. python src/main.py
